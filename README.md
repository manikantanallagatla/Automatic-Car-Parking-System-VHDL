# ***Automatic-Car-Parking-System-VHDL***:


----------
### *Aim*:

----------

Conventionally, car parking systems do not have any intelligent monitoring. Parking lots are monitored by human beings.
All vehicles enter into the parking and waste time searching for parking slots. Sometimes this can create blockages. 
Conditions worsen when there are multiple parking lanes and each lane has multiple parking slots.
Use of automated system for car parking monitoring will reduce human efforts. 
1. The system has to increment whenever a car is coming into the parking lot.
2. When a car leaves, the system has to decrement by 1 from the total count. 
3. Assume parking lot is finite (restricted the limit of parking spots to be 1024)
